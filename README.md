# Python-Playground

Hey there, this folder the first folder that I made for Python, I meant that these are amoung my first codes that I wrote for an actual coding laguage, so ofcourse they are so basic and childish but for beginners I think these are good, and hope you will find them interesting. These are amoung my favourite code that I have ever written and I love them all.
